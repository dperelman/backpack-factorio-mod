# Backpack Factorio mod

A mod to rename armors to backpacks to go along with
[Pacifist](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Pacifist) or other mods that
effectively disable combat, making armors no longer about protecting
from damage. To go along with that, this mod also removes all
resistances from all armors to reduce GUI clutter.

This currently only covers base game armors. Pull requests for covering
other mods are welcome.
